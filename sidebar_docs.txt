# Convert-a-card Web App
This app helps curators and cataloguers to choose between OCLC Worldcat matches for the title and author (if available) or ISBN on a catalogue card. The search on title/author/ISBN is done as part of separate process to identify potential matches, which are then uploaded into the app for review. The search is pre-filtered to include only physical versions of the work - all electronic formats are excluded.
## Using the app
### Selecting a card
In the card table at the top of the app use the grey column to the left of the card IDs to select a card to match. The card table shows the card ID, titles, authors, shelfmarks, complete OCR, and whether the card has already been matched. You can download as a csv, search, and expand the table by hovering over the table and using the icons that appear in the top right of the table. After expanding the table use the same icon to collapse it again, rather than clicking back or escape. Once you’ve selected a card, it will display below the table.

Familiarise yourself with the card, especially the more detailed information in the language specific text. This can help to choose between different editions of the same work. Information is displayed to the left of the card, including a link to the Worldcat search for the title/author, and a summary of the number of matches returned, how many are being displayed, and how many have been filtered out.
### Choosing between matches
Below the card is the table of MARC records that match the title/author search. Each column is a record, each row is a MARC field. The row index shows the MARC Field, and a subfield and “repeat ID” used to distinguish between fields that allow repeats such as 500, 650 and 880. The repeat ID is generated by the app to display records correctly, rather than anything within the MARC records.

The table shows all editions of a work, but includes only physical formats [[artchap-artcl, book-mic, book-thsis, book-printbook, jrnl-print]](https://help.oclc.org/Librarian_Toolbox/Searching_WorldCat_Indexes/Bibliographic_records/Format_Document_Type_values_and_codes/WorldShare_and_WorldCat_Discovery). Digital formats are excluded during the initial Worldcat search.

The default ordering of results left to right is the native OCLC “best match” ordering.

Cells in a row are highlighted if, for that MARC field, there are two or more matching results across the records. It’s possible to have more than one shared value across the records: if, for example, records 0 and 4 have one shared value for the 500 field and records 1 and 3 have a different shared value there will be two different highlight shades for the 500 field.

If a record has already been selected for a card, then that record will be highlighted green in the MARC table.

You can scroll through the table and expand columns as you would an excel preadsheet. You cannot edit the cells.

Below the table is a set of filters you can use to refine the records selection. Most filters have a help icon to provide further information on how filtering is done. The first option is 'Max records to display' - how many MARC records you’d like to display in the table. Increasing this allows you to see more records, but can increase the number of rows for repeat fields as the table has to accommodate the different repeat fields for different records.

You can also remove records you’ve identified as not matching the card to reduce the number displayed. Other filters include cataloguing language, publication date, a generic “Field contains” filter, and a set of sort options for things like record length and number of RDA fields if the basic OCLC “best match” order isn’t sufficient. There’s also the option to turn off common field highlighting between records.

Click “Apply filters” to apply them to the MARC table.
### Selecting a match
Once you’ve checked the MARC records and chosen a match or decided that none of them are accurate, enter your selection at the bottom of the page. Choose between the remaining records and click "Save selection". 
 
The next steps require access to OCLC Worldshare Record Manager. If you don't have access contact Harry Lloyd to arrange. Record Manager is a well designed MARC editor that Collections Metadata can access to handle onward processing of records once you have finished deriving records for card. It's recommended to have side-by-side tabs with this app and Record Manager open.  

Once you click "Save selection" the OCLC number and shelfmark are shown below ready to copy. Copy the OCLC number over to search in Record Manager, with Data Type: "Bibliographic Records", Scope: "All Worldcat", and changing Index to "OCLC Number". Clicking search will show the chosen record, there should be no equivalent electronic records for these cards so there should be no holdings under any BL OCLC code. 

Click Derive on the right hand side and edit the record as needed. Store the shelfmark in an 094 field, which Collections Metadata can insert into the catalogue. Once complete click "Save > Save In-Progress Record". Once you have completed all assigned cards contact Collections Metadata to take the completed records from Record Manager to be passed to the catalogue when available.

If you need to clear the chosen record for a card, ensure you have selected the right card at the top then click “Clear selection”.

Once a record is complete in Record Manager, return to the CaC app, click "Derivation complete" to mark complete in the Card table at the top of the app.
## Convert-a-Card
The aim of Convert-a-Card is to convert print card catalogues from the Library’s Asian and African Collections into electronic records, for inclusion in our online catalogue Explore.
A significant portion of the Library's extensive historical collections was acquired well before the advent of standard computer-based cataloguing. Consequently, even though the Library's online catalogue offers public access to tens of millions of records, numerous crucial research materials remain discoverable solely through searching the traditional physical card catalogues.

The physical cards provide essential information for each book, such as title, author, physical description (dimensions, number of pages, images, etc.), subject and a “shelfmark” – a reference to the item’s location. This information still constitutes the basic set of data to produce e-records in libraries and archives.
This app is the latest step in the Convert-a-Card project, and was designed by Harry Lloyd, working with Adi Keinan-Schoonbaert. We’re grateful for the support and time spent testing the app kindly given by Emma Harrison and Alexavier Lu from the Chinese Collection team, and Olivia Majumdar from the Urdu Collections team.
