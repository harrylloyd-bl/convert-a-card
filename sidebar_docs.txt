# Convert-a-card Web App
This app helps curators and cataloguers to choose between OCLC Worldcat matches for the title and author (if available) or ISBN on a catalogue card. The search on title/author/ISBN is done as part of separate process to identify potential matches, which are then uploaded into the app for review. The search is pre-filtered to include only physical versions of the work - all electronic formats are excluded.
## Using the app
### Selecting a card
Use the number entry box to select a card to match from the card table at the top of the page. The card table shows the card id column to select from, titles, authors, shelfmarks, and whether the card has already been matched. You can expand the table, search, and download it as csv by hovering over the table and using the icons in the toolbar that appear in the top right of the table. Once you’ve selected a card, it will display below the table.

Familiarise yourself with the card, especially the more detailed information in the language specific text. This can help to choose between different editions of the same work. Information is displayed to the left of the card, including a link to the Worldcat search for the title/author, and a summary of the number of matches returned, how many are being displayed, and how many have been filtered out.
### Choosing between matches
Below the card is the table of MARC records that match the title/author search. Each column is a record, each row is a MARC field. The row index shows the MARC Field, and a subfield and “repeat ID” used to distinguish between fields that allow repeats such as 500, 650 and 880. The repeat ID is generated by the app, rather than anything within the MARC records.

The table shows all editions of a work, but includes only physical formats [[artchap-artcl, book-mic, book-thsis, book-printbook, jrnl-print]](https://help.oclc.org/Librarian_Toolbox/Searching_WorldCat_Indexes/Bibliographic_records/Format_Document_Type_values_and_codes/WorldShare_and_WorldCat_Discovery). Digital formats are excluded during the initial Worldcat search.

The default ordering of results left to right is the native OCLC “best match” ordering.

Cells in a row are highlighted if, for that MARC field, there are two or more matching results across the records. It’s entirely possible to have more than one/ shared value across the records: if, for example, records 0 and 4 have one shared value for the 500 field and records 1 and 3 have a different shared value there will be two different highlight shades for the 500 field.

If a record has already been selected for a card, then that record will be highlighted green in the MARC table.

You can expand the table, search, and download it as csv by hovering over the table and using the icons in the toolbar that appear in the top right of the table. You can scroll through the table and expand columns as you would an excel spreadsheet. You cannot edit the cells.

Below the table is a set of filters you can use to refine the records selection. Most filters have a help icon to provide further information on how filtering is done. The first option is 'Max records to display' - how many MARC records you’d like to display in the table. Increasing this allows you to see more records, but can increase the number of rows for repeat fields as the table has to accommodate the different repeat fields for different records.

You can also remove records you’ve identified as not matching the card to reduce the number displayed. Other filters include cataloguing language, publication date, a generic “Field contains” filter, and a set of sort options for things like record length and number of RDA fields if the basic OCLC “best match” order isn’t sufficient. There’s also the option to turn off common field highlighting between records.

Once you’ve changed filters click “Apply filter” to apply them to the MARC table.
### Selecting a match
Once you’ve checked the MARC records and chosen a match, or decided that none of them are accurate, you can enter your selection at the bottom of the page. Choose between the remaining records excluding the ones you have marked as incorrect, then select whether the record is ready to be ingested into Aleph or whether it will require further editing. If it requires further editing then [NOTE - the rest of this process hasn't been finalised] a 500 field note will be added stating “Convert-a-Card app derived record, requires editing”. Once the record has been loaded into Aleph search on this field and edit the record as you would any other record in Aleph.

Alternatively there's an option to download a csv of all records to be ingested and edit in excel. Once you are happy with your selection click “Save selection”. If you need to clear the chosen record for a card, ensure you have selected the right card at the top then click “Clear selection”.
## Convert-a-Card
The aim of Convert-a-Card is to convert print card catalogues from the Library’s Asian and African Collections into electronic records, for inclusion in our online catalogue Explore.
A significant portion of the Library's extensive historical collections was acquired well before the advent of standard computer-based cataloguing. Consequently, even though the Library's online catalogue offers public access to tens of millions of records, numerous crucial research materials remain discoverable solely through searching the traditional physical card catalogues.

The physical cards provide essential information for each book, such as title, author, physical description (dimensions, number of pages, images, etc.), subject and a “shelfmark” – a reference to the item’s location. This information still constitutes the basic set of data to produce e-records in libraries and archives.
This app is the latest step in the Convert-a-Card project, and was designed by Harry Lloyd, working with Adi Keinan-Schoonbaert. We’re grateful for the support and time spent testing the app kindly given by Emma Harrison and Alexavier Lu from the Chinese Collection team, and Olivia Majumdar from the Urdu Collections team.
